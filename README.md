Car Rental System
This project involves the development of a car rental system using the Django Framework.

Overview of Django:
Django is a Model-View-Template (MVT) web framework utilized for constructing web applications. It offers an integrated administration interface, allowing efficient management of models, user/group permissions, and user administration. With its built-in model interface, Django eliminates the necessity for a separate database administration program for most basic database operations. Additionally, Django provides robust security features, such as password hashing for authentication purposes. It offers flexibility by supporting various functionalities and components, with the option to extend capabilities as needed.
